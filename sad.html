    <p class="newTitle">Rabbit Hole</p>
    <p class="newPoem">I fell down a hole <br> With no rabbit in sight. <br> No fairy tale ending,<br> Or wishes by night.<br> <br>This house that I’ve dug <br>Is more than to hide.<br> I’m stuck by myself<br> With ghosts by my side.<br><br> Temporary life<br> Fits a temporary
        living.
        <br> This pit where I lay,<br> the gift that keeps giving.

    <p class="newTitle">Asleep</p>
    <p class="newPoem">I’m falling asleep.<br>
        <br> And not the kind of sleep<br> Where one drifts off to a happy place,<br> But one were things are dark and tiring.<br> Filling the void with more empty spaces.<br>
        <br> I’m falling asleep.<br>
        <br> I’m beginning to lose all focus,<br> Trying to keep my mind awake and sound,<br> But things are getting heavier<br> Forcing me to drop towards the ground.<br>
        <br> Thing’s don’t process.<br>
        <br> It’s like a worn-out train,<br> Needs to be fixed but no one’s around.<br> I wonder if there were warning signs,<br> Signs allowing me to escape from the bound.<br>
        <br> It’s creating distance,<br>
        <br> Distance away from other people,<br> Away from family and surrounding peers.<br> Is everything in check?<br> All the wires in place, with well-working gears?<br>
        <br> I’m falling asleep.<br>
        <br> But to sleep is to be open to everything,<br> It is where all the feelings rain in.<br> Drowning everything else until it’s gone,<br> Making me feel guilty even where there is no sin,<br> And pondering what stars I’ve been wishing upon.<br>
        <br> I’m falling asleep.<br> I’m falling asleep.<br>
        <br> I dread the day that I no longer fear it.<br> The day in which I’ve succumbed to it all.<br> I may be small in stature,<br> But I want to remain standing metaphorically tall.<br>
    </p>

    <br>
    <p class="newTitle">A Friend's Betrayal</p>
    <p class="newPoem"> A friend’s betrayal<br> Hurts more than a love’s.<br> For you give your heart to your love,<br> But your entirety to the friend.<br>
    </p>
