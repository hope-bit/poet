    <p class="newTitle">Rabbit Hole</p>
    <p class="newPoem">I fell down a hole <br> With no rabbit in sight. <br> No fairy tale ending,<br> Or wishes by night.<br> <br>This house that I’ve dug <br>Is more than to hide.<br> I’m stuck by myself<br> With ghosts by my side.<br><br> Temporary life<br> Fits a temporary
        living.
        <br> This pit where I lay,<br> the gift that keeps giving.
