    <ah> About</ah>
    <br>
    <abt> My name is Hope Wilson and I am a 17 year-old in Maryland. I am an avid TV and movie watcher, music-listener, and poem-writer. I have always loved writing poetry in class, but the outbreak of school shootings across the U.S. became my biggest inspiration.
        I found that poetry allowed me to express my feelings of anxiety over these situations, and could provide motivation to pursue better regulations. In doing so I found my love for poetry in all forms. I hope you enjoy my writing, and feel free
        to reach out down below.</abt>
