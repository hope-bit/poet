    <h1> About</h1>
    <p> My name is Hope Wilson and I am a 17 year-old in Maryland. I am an avid TV and movie watcher, music-listener, and poem-writer. I have always loved writing poetry in class, but the outbreak of school shootings across the U.S. became my biggest inspiration.
        I found that poetry allowed me to express my feelings of anxiety over these situations, and could provide motivation to pursue better regulations.</p>
    <h1> Social Media</h1>
    <p> I can be found on social media @hopewilson.i for my personal instagram, and @hope.thepoet for my instagram that posts updates for this website</p>
