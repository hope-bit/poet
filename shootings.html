    <p class="newTitle"> Another Monday</p>
    <p class="newPoem">I stumble through the school,<br> talking to my friends.<br> A normal Monday morning,<br> with pencils and pens.<br>
        <br> A loud noise fills the air,<br> classmates turn frightened.<br> Shouting begins,<br> my heart rate is heightened.<br>
        <br> My feet begin running,<br> with my mind still frozen,<br> as I hear a student ask,<br> “Why was this school chosen?”<br>
        <br> The fireworks come closer,<br> I pull on doors to hide.<br> But teachers have a duty,<br> to protect those locked inside.<br>
        <br> Brain fires thoughts,<br> where to go, where to run?<br> I find I’m out of options,<br> and fear my death has begun.<br>
        <br> I get a slight chill,<br> from an ear-piercing scream.<br> Red flows around the corner,<br> like water from a stream.<br>
        <br> Footsteps approach me, <br> a mask in front of my face.<br> As the barrel meets my eye,<br> I see my darkened bookcase.<br>
        <br> I sit up in bed,<br> my eyes still adjusting.<br> “It was just a dream,”<br> I say, yet untrusting.<br>
        <br> But that’s just it,<br> this is no nightmare.<br> It may not be here,<br> but it’s reality is elsewhere.<br>
        <br> A school close by,<br> a school far away.<br> Different students will face,<br> another normal Monday. </p>

    <p class="newTitle">To Hear and To See</p>
    <p class="newPoem">First I hear a loud bang;<br> I see a kid fall.<br> Surely he’s just tripped<br> and slammed into the wall.<br>
        <br> And then I hear the screams,<br> then I see the red,<br> as the horizontal rain,<br> tears flesh like it’s thread.<br>
        <br> That's when I hear the running;<br> when I see the still figures.<br> Is this what they feel,<br> the bodies in the pictures?<br>
        <br> The people I hear on T.V.,<br> people I see online,<br> the others who have faced,<br> this experience of mine.<br>
        <br> Now I hear the breathing,<br> I see the heavy boots.<br> I’m alone in the hall now,<br> with the person who shoots.<br>

    <p class="newTitle">Another</p>
    <p class="newPoem"> Another day,<br> Another mention.<br> Something old,<br> creates more tension.<br>
        <br> Another face,<br> Hidden in the sky.<br> Another grave,<br> Left for to die.<br>
        <br> Another school,<br> Another piece of news.<br> Another terror,<br> Left behind bloodied shoes.<br>
        <br> Another loud noise<br> Another long pause.<br> Loud screaming,<br> Fills all the halls.<br>
        <br> Another body,<br> Thuds as it hits the floor.<br> Another person,<br> Behind a locker door,<br>
        <br> Another shooting,<br> Gone goes a friend.<br> Another tragedy,<br> Where is the end?<br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="newTitle">If I Die</p>
    <p class="newPoem">If I die,<br> Post it everywhere,<br> Use my name as a war cry<br> To demand better.<br> If I die,<br> Remember it’s your fault<br> Racism was more important<br> Than bringing bullets to a halt.<br> If I die,<br> Let this be a symbol<br> That your
        negligence,
        <br> Has inspired art as a whole.<br> If I die,<br> Of another white supremacist,<br> Don’t tell me I’M the nazi<br> For being a feminist.<br> If I die,<br> At a concert or in class,<br> Save your thoughts and prayers<br> For the rest of the mass.<br>        Because if I die,<br> I can no longer fight<br> For the good not the rich,<br> As I’ve now entered the light.<br>
