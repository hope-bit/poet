    <p class="newTitle"> Another Monday</p>
    <p class="newPoem">I stumble through the school,<br> talking to my friends.<br> A normal Monday morning,<br> with pencils and pens.<br>
        <br> A loud noise fills the air,<br> classmates turn frightened.<br> Shouting begins,<br> my heart rate is heightened.<br>
        <br> My feet begin running,<br> with my mind still frozen,<br> as I hear a student ask,<br> “Why was this school chosen?”<br>
        <br> The fireworks come closer,<br> I pull on doors to hide.<br> But teachers have a duty,<br> to protect those locked inside.<br>
        <br> Brain fires thoughts,<br> where to go, where to run?<br> I find I’m out of options,<br> and fear my death has begun.<br>
        <br> I get a slight chill,<br> from an ear-piercing scream.<br> Red flows around the corner,<br> like water from a stream.<br>
        <br> Footsteps approach me, <br> a mask in front of my face.<br> As the barrel meets my eye,<br> I see my darkened bookcase.<br>
        <br> I sit up in bed,<br> my eyes still adjusting.<br> “It was just a dream,”<br> I say, yet untrusting.<br>
        <br> But that’s just it,<br> this is no nightmare.<br> It may not be here,<br> but it’s reality is elsewhere.<br>
        <br> A school close by,<br> a school far away.<br> Different students will face,<br> another normal Monday. </p>
