    <p class="newTitle">The word Love</p>
    <p class="newPoem">Saying the word love, <br> Flies off my tongue like a dove.<br> Feels as if I rise above,<br> Maybe trying on a new glove.<br>
        <br> I’ll strain my awaiting ear,<br> Listening for the words I so want to hear.<br> I can tell that it is almost near,<br> Coming to make my world less clear.<br>
        <br> Except, what if I don’t mean what I say,<br> What if instead of words I found a new way?<br> A way for emotions to no longer stray,<br> And to keep the feelings tightly at bay.<br>
        <br> I’ve yet to actually say the word,<br> They have beat me in the race of being heard.<br> It seems fast yet slow, a little absurd,<br> But it feels right, so I rest assured.<br>
        <br>
