    <p>These are new poems</p>
    <p>I fell down a hole With no rabbit in sight. No fairy tale ending, Or wishes by night. This house that I’ve dug Is more than to hide. I’m stuck by myself With ghosts by my side. Temporary life Fits a temporary living. This pit where I lay, the gift
        that keeps giving.
